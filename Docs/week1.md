## 2. Distribution selection justification

I chose Ubuntu over the other distributions because when I tried to install Fedora, it did not run smoothly on my laptop despite making adjustments to the settings. Ubuntu runs smoothly on my laptop and does not give me any issues.

## 3. Workstation configuration decision

I chose Option B because my laptop only has 8GB of RAM and Ubuntu on it's own uses 4GB. So I came to the conclusion that running 2 virtual machines at the same time wouldn't be a good idea.

## 4. Network configuration
